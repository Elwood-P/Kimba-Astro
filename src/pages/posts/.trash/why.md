I scan down the trail ahead of my front wheel, but I already know what’s coming: tangled sideways roots; toaster-sized, squared-edged rocks; a right-left-right series of pocket berms; and then, lurking beyond it all, the slab. Each obstacle fills my mind like a folder in a filing cabinet, a progression of corresponding skill sets required to navigate each specific feature. All are necessary, and all are vying for my immediate attention.

Some days, riding this section of trail feels like I’m fumbling through those folders in mental oven mitts, frantically searching but never finding the right one. Meanwhile, I bobble along, each mistake amplified by thoughts of the impending slab and my ego: You better get your shit together.

But today is not one of those days. Today, the ride is perfect.

It starts with the sounds. My tire knobs ripping damp dirt like the pull of a zipper. The pop, pop, pop of my wheels skittering across the tops of rocks. The airy squish of my suspension as I unweight.

Then, silence. The anxiety of the unsorted folders—even about the slab—is gone. Everything turns fluid. My movements align with the obstacles: my knees pointing to increase grip, my joints relaxing for better range of motion, my eyes focusing not on the obstacles but the channels between. I cease to be aware of myself as something separate from what I am doing. I have become a coherent wave of action. I have achieved the flow state. And it feels really damn good.
